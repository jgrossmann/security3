Security Architecture and Engineering Homework 3

To compile this assignment, type: make

To run this program, type: ./appendtofile

This program takes user input from stdin in an infinite loop until
ctrl+C is pressed. To enter in a line of data to the program, type two strings
followed by the enter key (or whatever makes data appear in stdin pipe). If the data
was appended to the specified file for each line entered to the program, the string: "SUCESS"
should appear. If any are not successful for whatever reason, an error string should print, 
but the program will most likely continue. 




I did not include any of my tests to run with the makefile because it proved
too time consumingn to write out tests that would be piped into the program while 
the program continued to run. Instead, I just performed manual tests because the program
takes user input, and I could also greatly vary the tests if needed with efficiency. 



Typing "/." will result in the path: "/..jg3538" as per the email. 
Typing "/" will result in the path: "/.jg3538" as per the email.
Typing "/tmp/.." will result in the path: "/.jg3538" The ".." gets parsed as it normally should.

I was not sure about this, so I made it so that any quote type must be escaped if inside a quoted
string of any quote type. So '"' would not work. "'" would not work.
