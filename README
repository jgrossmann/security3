Security Architecture and Engineering Homework 3

To compile this assignment, type: make

To run this program, type: ./appendtofile

This program takes user input from stdin in an infinite loop until
ctrl+C is pressed, or the word quit is entered. To enter in a line of data to the program, type two strings
followed by the enter key (or whatever makes data appear in stdin pipe). If the data
was appended to the specified file for each line entered to the program, the string: "SUCESS"
should appear. If any are not successful for whatever reason, an error string should print, 
but the program will most likely continue. 



I included all the tests I ran in the testCommands.txt file. This can be run by typing: make test.


To run your own tests, you can start the program with ./appendtofile and enter as much input as you like.
You can also type: make exec ARG=<filename>
where the filename is the name of the file containing the test commands line by line. 

*NOTE: if you put the single word: quit    in your tests, it will end the program.


Typing "/." will result in the path: "/..jg3538" as per the email. 
Typing "/" will result in the path: "/.jg3538" as per the email.
Typing "/tmp/.." will result in the path: "/.jg3538" The ".." gets parsed as it normally should.

I was not sure about this, so I made it so that any quote type must be escaped if inside a quoted
string of any quote type. So '"' would not work. "'" would not work.
